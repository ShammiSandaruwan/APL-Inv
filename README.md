# Estate Asset Management System

This is a comprehensive, production-ready Estate Asset Management System to digitalize and manage estates with their buildings, furniture, equipment, and inventory.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To get the application running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (v9 or later)
-   A Supabase account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1.  **Create a new Supabase project.**
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard.
3.  Execute the following SQL scripts from the `supabase/` directory in this order:
    1.  `mvp_schema.sql` - Sets up the initial tables for estates, buildings, and items.
    2.  `storage_setup.sql` - Configures the public bucket for image storage.
    3.  `audit_log_schema.sql` - Creates the audit trail table and triggers.
    4.  `user_roles_schema.sql` - Adds user profile management and role-based security.
    5.  `secure_get_my_role.sql` - Adds a security function to prevent infinite recursion in RLS policies.
    6. `make_bucket_public.sql` - Makes the storage bucket public.
4.  Navigate to **Authentication -> Users** and create a new user. This will be your initial "Super Admin" account.
5.  Navigate to **Project Settings -> API**. You will need the **Project URL** and the **`anon` public API Key**.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
2.  Add your Supabase credentials to the file:

    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY
    ```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
